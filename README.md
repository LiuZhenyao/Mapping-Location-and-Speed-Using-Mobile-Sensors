# Mapping-Location-and-Speed-Using-Mobile-Sensors
This project shows how to collect position data from an Android device and display it on a map.
Latitude and longitude coordinates are used to mark the device's route. 
Speed information is used to add color to the route. 
The final result is a visual representation of location and speed for the device's journey
